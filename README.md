## 🎯 Problem Statement

Nigeria faces significant challenges with:
- Unreliable electricity supply affecting daily cooking activities
- High cost of cooking fuel (gas) : on the average, nigerians spend up to ₦15,000 monthly on cooking gas - and that's ₦180,000 annually
- Environmental concerns from traditional biomass cooking
- Energy poverty in off-grid communities

Our solution provides a clean, efficient, and intelligent cooking alternative powered by renewable energy.
